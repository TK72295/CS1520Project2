I updated the website to include the ability to register or login as a user.  The main benefit of this is if you login using the Email/Username of 'admin' with password 'admin', you can now add members to the database on the fly.

In addition, jQuery/Javascript are used to check login forms and submit to a php script to handle login/registration.  Javascript is also used to update the contact form to tell the user that their submission was completed and to tell admin if their user add was done properly.

I also put my website on Amazon AWS.  It can be accessed by going to http://54.152.0.60/index.php.
