                <h2>What is Judo?</h2>

                <p>Judo (meaning "gentle way") is a Japanese martial art that was created in 1882 by Dr. Jigoro Kano.
                    Dr. Kano was a jujutsu practitioner who wanted to make a martial art that could be practiced safely 
                    while still being competitive in nature.  Many of jujutsu's techniques were meant to injure or incapacitate, 
                    making it very difficult to practice effectively.  Kano distilled judo from the safer techniques of jujutsu while 
                    leaving out the more dangerous ones.  The end result was a set of 40 throws, numerous submissions, and a number of 
                    striking techniques.

                        <p>Judo became an Olympic sport at the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan.  Most judoka follow the Olympic rules 
                            which are set by the International Judo Federation.  Judo is typically performed wearing a gi, a uniform that 
                            is composed of a thick jacket and pants.  The gi enables many of grips and throws that set judo apart from wrestling 
                            or non-gi martial arts.  In competition, there are three routes to victory.  They are:

                        <ul>
                            <li>Throwing your opponent flat on their back</li>
                            <li>Pinning your opponent for 20 seconds</li>
                            <li>Causing your opponent to submit through choke or armlock</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Judo is one of the most popular martial arts in the world and has practitioners on all continents.  There are two 
                            main principles that Dr. Kano had in mind when developing judo: "maximum efficiency with minimal effort" and "mutual 
                            benefit and welfare".  Kano wanted judo to be practiced so that using your opponent's force against them was the main focus, 
                            not simply overpowering them.  He believed tha perfect timing and technique could overcome any strength deficit.  He also believed 
                            that judo was something that could only effectively practiced with a partner and that the ultimate goal of practice was to get 
                            better together.  Kano believed in these principles not only in the context of judo, but also as the foundation of a way of life.
